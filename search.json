    "text": "Takeaways\nIt is worth noting that initially GPT did a great job at remembering this simple fact after preventing it with a few number of facts, but as that number grew, at some point it was not able to remeber the intial piece of information. My understanding is that this is because there is memory that GPT uses that will run out at a certain point. I would also imagine (as noted above) that the length of the input and information GPT has to remember would impact how many messages can pass while GPT retains this information - which at a certain point is system design more than anything else."
