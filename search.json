I am going to increase the number of facts about myself to see where it will cap out and forget that my favorite color is dark green. I recognize that part of this constraint is the number of tokens I provide an LLM to remember (that is to say that a 100 word prompt in between would likely have more of an impact than a five word prompt), however for the purpose of this experiment I will only be counting based on the number of “facts” that I provide the LLM.\nThis relevant as when asking simple questions most LLMs can provide a response in the context of their trianing, but one of the more powerful use cases is when it can easily interact wiht user provided information.

    "text": "Takeaways\nIt is worth noting that initially GPT did a great job at remembering this simple fact after preventing it with a few number of facts, but as that number grew, at some point it was not able to remeber the intial piece of information. My understanding is that this is because there is memory that GPT uses that will run out at a certain point. I would also imagine (as noted above) that the length of the input and information GPT has to remember would impact how many messages can pass while GPT retains this information - which at a certain point is system design more than anything else."
