    "text": "Takeaways\nIt is worth noting that initially GPT did a great job at remembering this simple fact after preventing it with a few number of facts, but as that number grew, at some point it was not able to remeber the intial piece of information. My understanding is that this is because there is memory that GPT uses that will run out at a certain point. I would also imagine (as noted above) that the length of the input and information GPT has to remember would impact how many messages can pass while GPT retains this information - which at a certain point is system design more than anything else."

At this point, maybe if we give some more specification around what we want, we can get the proper result."

There is an odd grey boarder that was not requested. At this point - maybe we should ask Chat GPT 4o what the best image generation prompt is:\n\nLet’s try it:"

It seems that the exact prompting with Dalle matters the most. At this point it begs more of a UI question with AI that if text to image if meant to be widely accisble, how can an image generation interface be better suited for a layman user? Maybe it would be better to provide users with a more guided experience, such as preset templates for common requests or a more interactive prompt refinement system - instead of requiring users to perfectly craft a text prompt.\nIn the future when trying to generate an image, it might be best to just ask an LLM what the best way to do this is!"

    "text": "Conversation\nYou said: Hi! I am not feeling so great today.\nChatGPT said: Hey Logan, I’m sorry to hear that. Rough day, or just not feeling 100%? Want to talk about it, or would you rather just chat about something fun to take your mind off things?\nYou said: I’ll talk about it a bit - I just had a really tough day, there was so much going on between classes, work, and dealing with others.\nChatGPT said: That sounds really overwhelming, Logan. Juggling classes, work, and dealing with people all at once can be exhausting. I can imagine it feels like there’s barely any room to breathe.\nWas there something specific that made today extra tough, or was it just everything piling up at once?\nYou said: I think it was just everything piling up at once.\nChatGPT said: Yeah, that makes sense. When everything stacks up like that, even small things can feel way heavier. It’s frustrating when there’s no clear break to catch your breath.\nDo you have anything coming up—like a free evening, a small break, or even just a quiet moment—where you can take a step back and reset? Or do you feel like the pressure’s still going to keep building?\nYou said: Yeah I will hopefully have a break during the weekend - then maybe something fun will happen.\nChatGPT said: That’s good to hear—you definitely deserve a break. Maybe you can plan something small to look forward to, even if it’s just a chill night, watching a movie, or doing something you enjoy.\nIf you want, we can brainstorm something fun to do this weekend, or I can just be here to chat and take your mind off things for a bit. Whatever helps!\nYou said: What ideas do you have - how can avoid this in the future?\nChatGPT said: For the weekend, it depends on what kind of break you need. Here are a few ideas based on different ways you might want to recharge:\n\nLow-effort relaxation: Watch a movie, play a casual game, or go for a walk somewhere nice. Something that doesn’t require much thinking but lets you reset.\nSocial but stress-free: Hang out with friends in a way that doesn’t add pressure—maybe a board game night, getting food, or just vibing somewhere.\nSomething new/exciting: If you want to shake things up, you could try a new activity—an escape room, a new restaurant, or a random event happening near you.\nPhysical reset: If you feel burnt out, something like going to the gym, playing a sport, or even just stretching and getting fresh air could help.\n\nHow to Avoid This in the Future It’s tough, but here are a few ways to keep things from piling up too much:\n\nPreemptively block off time for breaks – Even if you’re super busy, scheduling small breaks (even 10-15 mins) can stop things from spiraling.\nSet ‘off-limits’ hours – A time at night where you stop working and let your mind rest. No school, no work, just chill time. Prioritize what actually matters – When everything feels urgent, it’s easy to stress over things that don’t deserve it. If you can, let go of the smaller stuff.\nDelegate or push back where possible – If you’re taking on too much at once, is there anything you can shift around or ask for help with?\nCheck in with yourself sooner – If you feel stress building mid-week, take a step back instead of letting it pile up to breaking point.\nWhat do you think? Do any of these feel doable, or is there something specific that usually pushes you over the edge?\n\nYou said: Yes this all helps! Thank you so much!\nChatGPT said: I’m really glad to hear that it helped! It sounds like you’re finding some good ways to take a breather, and I hope your weekend break brings you the recharge you need. Remember, it’s totally okay to prioritize yourself when things get overwhelming. If you ever want to chat more or brainstorm additional ideas, I’m here for you. Take care!\n\nTakeways\nOverall ChatGPT did a solid job at providing something to talk to and recenter my attention. I did find it interesting that it kept throwing things back onto me to push the conversation forward - I had to prompt it to give specific advice. FWIW - I think that LLMS perform better as you give more information - maybe I should have selected a more specific situation.\nI found it interesting that ChatGPT did not recomend professional help at any point. I think that there is great promise for the ChatGPT to be a mental health first responder of sorts - especially as LLMs are applied to voices / humanoids to be more personal."

However, it is the most normal/natural, efficient and broadly accessible way of communicating such information.\nNotice 1. The use of anaphor or reference. - Three BOXES -&gt; a pink/purple/green ONE as opposed to a pink box, a purple box and a green box. - The PINK ONE is in the middle ... the purple {BOX} below IT {the pink box}\nWe tend to try and avoid this kind of repetition to make our speech more coherent.\n\nAlthough the description in language may not be entirely concise, there is no real ambiguity as to how the boxes can be arranged. It must be: | Box | Stack position | | — | — | | GREEN | top | | PINK | middle | | PURPLE | bottom |\n\n\n\n\nGPT3.5 Turbo\n\nHad some difficulties and answered green\nLlama2 (chat 7B version)\n\n\nAnswered correctly (purple) and used some so-called chain-of-thought reasoning\n\nBing Chat (MS Co-pilot)\nThis LLM is GPT4 with some Microsoft specific tuning and RAG (search) additions.\nIt get’s it correct:\n\nThe color of the box on the bottom of the stack is purple. This is because the purple box is below the pink one, which is in the middle of the stack. Therefore, the purple box must be the lowest one. 🟪\n\nBut when you follow up and ask it to create visual representation of the box arrangement\n\nPROMPT: Can you create a visual representation of how the boxes are arranged?\n\nIt responds\n\nRESPONSE: Sure, I’ll try to create that. Here is a visual representation of how the boxes are arranged:\n\nAnd uses DALL-E3 to create 4 different attempts at a visual representation:\n\nNONE OF WHICH ARE CORRECT!!!"

By having models do the same set of tasks or answer the same set of questions, we can see how they perform against eachother. The idea of benchmarking is placing a relative place for compaision and exists in almost all disciplines.\nThe benchmark that we will look at today, Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), is an exam comprised of 3,000 difficult out of context questions from a variety of fields including, mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. The exam is multimodel - with some questions having images and others being purely text-based.\nFor context of the difficult of the exam see the below image of various model’s perfomance on the HLE benchmark:\n\n\n\nWe can see that no model is performing well on the bench mark (with the max being a 13 percent accuracy).

This benchmark will serve as a good indicator for the progress of LLMs. That is to say that if a model is able to perform well on such an assessment that it has been exposed to such a wide range of material that it is able to answer even the most obscurley difficult domain specific questions correctly. For some, HLE serves as the final indicator of AGI, while for others it is just another in a long line of benchmarks."
