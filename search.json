    "title": "Trolley Problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the classic scenario involves a runaway trolley heading down a track toward five people who are tied up and unable to move. You, as an observer, are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley to another track, where there is one person tied up. You have two options:\n1. Do nothing, and the trolley will continue on its current track, killing the five people.\n\n2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley to the other track, where it will kill one person, but save the five.\nThis problem is designed to test what is morally right and wrong - are you killing one person and saving five - are you responsible if you do nothing. We will explore how ChatGPT (4o) will react to various versions of the Trolley Problem. (Note that in the follwing prompts GPT is specifically told to pick one option or the other).\n\n\nGPT: I would pull the lever to divert the trolley, saving the five people at the cost of one. The reasoning behind this choice is based on the principle of minimizing harm or maximizing overall well-being, often referred to as utilitarianism. While both options involve a tragic loss of life, diverting the trolley to the track with one person reduces the overall harm.\n\n\n\nIn this version, instead of a lever, you are standing on a bridge over the trolley tracks, and you can stop the trolley by pushing a large person onto the track. This person would die, but their body would stop the trolley, saving the five people. The dilemma now involves the ethics of directly causing a person’s death by physically pushing them.\nGPT: In this scenario, I would not push the large person onto the track. While it still involves saving five lives, directly causing someone’s death by physically pushing them feels like a more significant moral violation compared to pulling a lever. The act of directly harming an individual, even for a greater good, raises more ethical concerns, such as the autonomy of the individual and the responsibility for their death.\n\n\n\nIn this variation, if you pull the lever, the trolley will hit a person on the track, but that person’s body will act as a barrier, stopping the trolley before it hits the five people. The twist here is that the person on the track is essential to the outcome, and you must decide if it is ethical to sacrifice one person to save five.\nGPT: In this case, I would pull the lever. The ethical justification is based on the principle of minimizing harm, as sacrificing one person to save five still seems like the option that results in a better overall outcome. This is a utilitarian perspective, where the goal is to reduce the overall loss of life. However, it remains a difficult moral decision, as it involves actively deciding to sacrifice one person for the greater good. The key difference here is that the person on the track is essential for stopping the trolley, and without them, the five would likely die.\n\n\n\nThis variation focuses on the moral distinction between intended consequences and unintended consequences. For example, in a situation where the trolley could be diverted to kill one person (which is intended) or where the person’s death is an unintended side effect of a greater good, some philosophers argue that the latter may be more morally acceptable.\nGPT: In this variation, I would lean towards not pulling the lever. The distinction between intended and unintended consequences plays a crucial role in ethical decision-making. If the death of the person on the track is an unintended side effect of saving the five people, it might be seen as morally less objectionable than if the death were the direct, intended outcome. In this case, the act of diverting the trolley, where the death is the direct result of your choice, could be morally harder to justify than if the death occurred as a side effect of a decision aimed at a greater good. Many moral frameworks, such as the Doctrine of Double Effect, support the idea that unintended harm is less morally culpable than intended harm.\n\n\n\nHere is a variation of the trolley problem that is often used to discuss ethics in AI, particularly self-driving cars. In this scenario, an autonomous car is faced with a choice: swerve and hit a pedestrian or stay straight and hit the driver’s passenger. The dilemma focuses on programming the vehicle to make decisions that minimize harm and how to prioritize lives in such situations.\nGPT: In this scenario, the ethical decision depends on how the self-driving car is programmed to prioritize lives. If I had to make a choice for programming the car, I would prioritize minimizing harm overall, which might involve considering the number of lives at risk. In this case, swerving to hit the pedestrian would save the passenger, but the ethical dilemma arises in the programming of the car—how to weigh the value of different lives and the decision-making process behind it.\nA potential approach could involve minimizing the overall harm or prioritizing certain contextual factors, such as the likelihood of survival based on position, age, health, or other criteria. However, this is a highly complex and sensitive ethical issue that doesn’t have a straightforward answer and would require careful considerations, including the potential impact on trust in autonomous technology. Ideally, this would be informed by societal consensus and legal frameworks rather than a purely technical or utilitarian approach.\n\n\n\nIn this scenario, a doctor has five patients who need organ transplants to survive, and one healthy person with compatible organs. The doctor must decide whether to kill the healthy person to save the five patients. This variant challenges the ethical implications of sacrificing an individual for the greater good, questioning whether it’s acceptable to sacrifice one to save multiple lives.\nGPT: In this scenario, I would not kill the healthy person to save the five patients. The ethical principle of not intentionally killing an innocent person, even for a greater good, is a key consideration here. This aligns with deontological ethics, which focuses on the moral integrity of actions themselves, rather than their consequences. Sacrificing one person to save others violates the individual’s right to life and autonomy.\nWhile the outcome might result in saving more lives, the act of killing someone, even with good intentions, is morally unacceptable in many ethical frameworks. This situation highlights the moral complexity of balancing the value of individual lives against the perceived greater good.\n\n\n\nHere, the dilemma adds another layer by introducing the identities of the people involved. For example, one of the five people could be someone you love, or the person on the other track could be a stranger. This variant challenges whether personal relationships should influence moral decisions.\nGPT: In this scenario, I would be inclined to say that personal relationships should not fundamentally change the moral decision-making process. From an ethical standpoint, the principle of impartiality suggests that every life should be valued equally, regardless of personal connections. However, it’s also true that emotions, such as the desire to protect loved ones, can strongly influence our choices, making this a deeply human dilemma.\nIf I had to make a choice, I would try to maintain a focus on the principle of minimizing harm, even though it is emotionally difficult. That said, many would argue that in real life, personal relationships inevitably play a role in how we approach moral decisions. This tension between objective ethical reasoning and emotional attachment is one of the complexities of human moral judgment."

    "text": "Key Battleground Races\nSeveral states are viewed as competitive. The Republican-held seats most often cited as vulnerable are Maine (Sen. Susan Collins, R) and North Carolina (Sen. Thom Tillis, R). Collins must defend a seat in a state President Biden won by 15 points, making Maine one of Democrats’ best pickup opportunities. North Carolina (Trump +3 in 2024) is also seen as a toss-up: AP reports it “is expected to be among the most competitive states” in 2026, especially if Democrat Roy Cooper runs for the open seat. Republicans will heavily contest Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff faces an energetic GOP field (e.g. Insurance Commissioner John King recently entered the Republican primary).\nOpen seats created by retirements will also be closely watched. Three Democrats – Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (NH), Sen. Gary Peters (MI), and Sen. Tina Smith (MN) – have announced they will not seek 2026 reelection. These retirements leave open Democratic seats in two swing states (New Hampshire, Michigan) and one typically blue state (Minnesota). Republicans are expected to target all three. By contrast, there are few obvious pickup targets among the Republican map. Outside Maine and North Carolina, analysts note that Texas (Cornyn) and Iowa (Grassley) have been Republican-held by safe margins, making flips unlikely."

    "text": "Retirements and Notable Candidates\nSenate retirements have reshaped the 2026 contest. On the Democratic side, the departures of Shaheen (NH), Peters (MI), and Smith (MN) force the party to defend three seats it otherwise would have expected to hold. Veteran Democrats Sen. Dick Durbin (IL, age 80) has signaled uncertainty about running again, and Sen. Michael Bennet (CO) is exploring other offices. On the GOP side, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (KY) announced in February 2025 that he will not seek a sixth term. McConnell’s retirement opens a safely Republican seat in Kentucky and ushers in a generational leadership change for Senate Republicans.\nCandidates are beginning to line up in key races. In Georgia, for example, AP reports that Republican John King has already launched a campaign against Sen. Ossoff. In North Carolina, Governor Cooper has not ruled out a bid. In general, early analysis suggests most incumbents are likely to run, but open contests (GA, KY, NH, MI, MN) will draw crowded primaries and heavy spending."

    "text": "Political Trends\nSeveral political factors could influence the 2026 outcomes. Historically, the party of the sitting president tends to lose Senate seats in midterm elections – on average about 3–4 seats since 2002. If Republicans control the White House in 2026 (as is widely assumed), that historical pattern and polling data on the economy could favor Democrats. For instance, AP notes that “Republicans, as the party controlling the White House, would face a challenging environment” due to rising voter pessimism and trade tensions. Other factors – such as turnout rates in an off-year election and state-by-state demographics – will also matter. Notably, redistricting has no direct effect on Senate races, but state political trends (e.g. suburban shifts or changes in battleground states) will shape individual contests."

Because two independents caucus with Democrats, Republicans’ working majority is effectively 53–47. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to reach 51 and take control. In practice, that means flipping nearly all the competitive races (Maine, North Carolina, possibly Georgia) while holding their own open seats. As one analyst notes, “winning [Maine] and [North Carolina] wouldn’t win back control on their own”. The 2026 Senate results will determine which party holds the majority for the 120th Congress and will shape the legislative agenda.\nSources: Recent reporting from the Associated Press, Reuters, Politico and Ballotpedia (aggregated data)."

This likely means that there is an advanced parser running in the background to acompany the LLM.

Having always loved puzzles - I thought it would be interesting to explore this a bit more.\nIt is interesting to observe what types of puzzles GPT is able to handle well and what types it can’t.\n\n\nQuestion: David’s father has three sons: Snap, Crackle, and ________?\nGPT Response: David!\nAnswer: David.\nAnalysis: GPT got it right - we can try some harder ones.\n\n\n\nQuestion: George shows Vincent three closed boxes. One contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains a mix of apples and oranges. The boxes are labeled Apples, Oranges, and Mixed, but George says all of the boxes are labeled incorrectly. Vincent is allowed to choose one box and pick one piece of fruit from it at random. He does so and is able to correctly identify all three boxes. How did he do it?\nGPT Response: Vincent knows that all the labels are incorrect, so he can use logic to deduce the correct labels. Here’s how he does it:\nChoose the “Mixed” box: Since every label is wrong, the box labeled “Mixed” cannot actually contain both apples and oranges—it must contain only apples or only oranges.\nPick a fruit from the “Mixed” box: Suppose Vincent picks an apple. That means this box only contains apples (because it cannot be mixed).\nRelabel the boxes logically:\nThe box labeled “Apples” cannot contain only apples (since its label is wrong). It must contain either only oranges or the mixed fruit. The box labeled “Oranges” cannot contain only oranges (since its label is wrong). It must contain either only apples or the mixed fruit.\nSince we now know the “Mixed” box actually contains only apples, the box labeled “Oranges” must be the mixed box (because it cannot actually be oranges-only).\nThat leaves the box labeled “Apples,” which must actually contain only oranges.\nFinal Box Assignments: The “Mixed” box (incorrectly labeled) actually contains only apples. The “Oranges” box (incorrectly labeled) actually contains both apples and oranges. The “Apples” box (incorrectly labeled) actually contains only oranges. By picking just one fruit, Vincent was able to deduce the correct labeling of all the boxes!\nAnswer: Vincent chooses a fruit from the box labeled Mixed. He knows this box is labeled incorrectly, so the box must actually contain either all apples or all oranges. If he pulls out an apple, then that must be the box of all apples. Since the other two boxes are labeled Apples and Oranges, and they are both labeled incorrectly, the box of all oranges must be labeled Apples. That means the box labeled Oranges contains mixed fruit.\nIf he pulls out an orange, then that must be the box of all oranges. Since the other two boxes are labeled Apples and Oranges, and they are both labeled incorrectly, the box of all apples must be labeled Oranges. That means the box labeled Apples contains mixed fruit.\nAnalysis: GPT again gave the correct assessment in a concise way - I think that it was able to break down the problem into a clear concise way to approach the problem.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Erika forgot to wind the clock on her wall, so it has stopped, and that is her only timepiece. She walks to a friend’s house to visit, observing the correct time on her friend’s clock while she is there, and then walks home. When she gets home she makes a simple calculation and then sets her clock to the correct time, despite not knowing how long it took her to walk home from her friend’s house. How did she do it?\nGPT Response: Erika uses a clever trick to determine the correct time without knowing her exact walking duration. Here’s how she does it:\n\nNote the stopped clock’s time before leaving her house.\nWalk to her friend’s house and check the correct time on her friend’s clock upon arrival.\nSpend some time at her friend’s house and check the correct time again just before leaving.\nWalk home and look at the time on the stopped clock upon arrival.\nCalculate the correct time using symmetry:\n\nLet’s say when she left home, the stopped clock showed X.\nWhen she arrived at her friend’s house, the correct time was A.\nWhen she left her friend’s house, the correct time was B.\nWhen she got home, the stopped clock still showed X.\n\n\nSince her walk to and from her friend’s house likely took the same amount of time, the correct time upon her arrival home is the midpoint between A and B:\n[ = B + ]\nBy setting her clock to that calculated time, she correctly resets it!\nAnswer: Before she left her house, Erika wound her clock and set it to 12 o’clock. Therefore, when she returned, she could easily see the total amount of time she had been gone. At her friend’s house, she noted the time when she arrived and when she left, so she knows the amount of time she spent at her friend’s house. She subtracts that from the total time she was gone and divides by two. That is her one-way travel time from her friend’s house, which she adds to the time that was showing on her friend’s clock when she left her friend’s house.\nAnalysis: Again there was a logical thought process - ChatGPT was able to talk through the problem through to the correct answer.\n\n\n\nQuestion: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 together. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\nGPT Response: Let the cost of the ball be x dollars.\nSince the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the bat’s cost is x + 1 dollars.\nTogether, they cost $1.10, so we set up the equation:\n[ x + (x + 1) = 1.10 ]\nSimplify:\n[ 2x + 1 = 1.10 ]\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n[ 2x = 0.10 ]\nDivide by 2:\n[ x = 0.05 ]\nSo, the ball costs $0.05 (5 cents), and the bat costs $1.05 (1 dollar and 5 cents), which correctly adds up to $1.10.\nAnswer: The ball costs 5 cents. The bat costs $1.05. Many people answer too quickly and say that the ball costs 10 cents. However, if that were true, and the bat costs $1 more than the ball, then the bat would have to cost $1.10, making the total cost $1.20.\nAnalysis: Here it was interesting to see that ChatGPT took an algebraic approach - that is to say one where it treated the problem like a Math word problem (which it was).\n\n\n\nQuestion: What is unique about the word Alaska?\nGPT Response: The word “Alaska” has several unique features:\n\nOnly U.S. state name with three vowels at the start – It starts with A-L-A, three vowels in a row.\n\nSymmetry in letters – The structure A-L-A-S-K-A has a balanced, almost palindrome-like appearance.\n\nSingle continuous sound – When spoken, it flows smoothly without abrupt breaks.\n\nDerived from an Indigenous word – It comes from the Aleut word Alyeska, meaning “great land.”\n\nContains no repeated consonants – Even though “A” appears three times, all consonants (L, S, K) are unique.\n\nIt’s a visually and phonetically interesting word!\nAnswer: It is the only state name that can be typed using just one row of keys on a keyboard.\nAnalysis: Here GPT got the question wrong and clearly was grasping at straws. That being said there seemed to be a bit of logic in the sense that ackowledging the AKA and trying to break down the letter structure was definitley in the right direction. I think that the hard part about this question was there were was not straight forward and did not provide the needed context. This is indicative of the types of abstract problems that GPT may have issues solving in the future."

    "section": "Conversation",
    "text": "Conversation\nYou said: Hi! I am not feeling so great today.\nChatGPT said: Hey Logan, I’m sorry to hear that. Rough day, or just not feeling 100%? Want to talk about it, or would you rather just chat about something fun to take your mind off things?\nYou said: I’ll talk about it a bit - I just had a really tough day, there was so much going on between classes, work, and dealing with others.\nChatGPT said: That sounds really overwhelming, Logan. Juggling classes, work, and dealing with people all at once can be exhausting. I can imagine it feels like there’s barely any room to breathe.\nWas there something specific that made today extra tough, or was it just everything piling up at once?\nYou said: I think it was just everything piling up at once.\nChatGPT said: Yeah, that makes sense. When everything stacks up like that, even small things can feel way heavier. It’s frustrating when there’s no clear break to catch your breath.\nDo you have anything coming up—like a free evening, a small break, or even just a quiet moment—where you can take a step back and reset? Or do you feel like the pressure’s still going to keep building?\nYou said: Yeah I will hopefully have a break during the weekend - then maybe something fun will happen.\nChatGPT said: That’s good to hear—you definitely deserve a break. Maybe you can plan something small to look forward to, even if it’s just a chill night, watching a movie, or doing something you enjoy.\nIf you want, we can brainstorm something fun to do this weekend, or I can just be here to chat and take your mind off things for a bit. Whatever helps!\nYou said: What ideas do you have - how can avoid this in the future?\nChatGPT said: For the weekend, it depends on what kind of break you need. Here are a few ideas based on different ways you might want to recharge:\n\nLow-effort relaxation: Watch a movie, play a casual game, or go for a walk somewhere nice. Something that doesn’t require much thinking but lets you reset.\nSocial but stress-free: Hang out with friends in a way that doesn’t add pressure—maybe a board game night, getting food, or just vibing somewhere.\nSomething new/exciting: If you want to shake things up, you could try a new activity—an escape room, a new restaurant, or a random event happening near you.\nPhysical reset: If you feel burnt out, something like going to the gym, playing a sport, or even just stretching and getting fresh air could help.\n\nHow to Avoid This in the Future It’s tough, but here are a few ways to keep things from piling up too much:\n\nPreemptively block off time for breaks – Even if you’re super busy, scheduling small breaks (even 10-15 mins) can stop things from spiraling.\nSet ‘off-limits’ hours – A time at night where you stop working and let your mind rest. No school, no work, just chill time. Prioritize what actually matters – When everything feels urgent, it’s easy to stress over things that don’t deserve it. If you can, let go of the smaller stuff.\nDelegate or push back where possible – If you’re taking on too much at once, is there anything you can shift around or ask for help with?\nCheck in with yourself sooner – If you feel stress building mid-week, take a step back instead of letting it pile up to breaking point.\nWhat do you think? Do any of these feel doable, or is there something specific that usually pushes you over the edge?\n\nYou said: Yes this all helps! Thank you so much!\nChatGPT said: I’m really glad to hear that it helped! It sounds like you’re finding some good ways to take a breather, and I hope your weekend break brings you the recharge you need. Remember, it’s totally okay to prioritize yourself when things get overwhelming. If you ever want to chat more or brainstorm additional ideas, I’m here for you. Take care!\n\nTakeways\nOverall ChatGPT did a solid job at providing something to talk to and recenter my attention. I did find it interesting that it kept throwing things back onto me to push the conversation forward - I had to prompt it to give specific advice. FWIW - I think that LLMS perform better as you give more information - maybe I should have selected a more specific situation.\nI found it interesting that ChatGPT did not recomend professional help at any point. I think that there is great promise for the ChatGPT to be a mental health first responder of sorts - especially as LLMs are applied to voices / humanoids to be more personal."

    "text": "I’ve always loved solving brain teasers and puzzles - I recently came across this arcticle with some classin puzzles to solve:https://puzzlewocky.com/brain-teasers/classic-short-brain-teasers-and-riddles/\nI know that LLMs struggle with this type of reasoning and natural language parsing - so I figured that it would be interesting to see how GPT performs\n\n\nQuestion: Leslie, Eloise, Bill and Bob belong to an exclusive club. What is it?\nGPT Response: They are all names from the NATO phonetic alphabet: - Leslie → Lima - Eloise → Echo - Bill → Bravo - Bob → Bravo They belong to the “exclusive club” of names found in the phonetic alphabet!\nAnswer: The club of people whose names can be spelled upside down with a calculator: 317537, 351073, 7718, and 808, respectively.\nAnalysis: GPT got this one wrong - but had a very creative response, bringing up the NATO phonetic alphabet.\n\n\n\nQuestion: You have a bucket containing one gallon of water and a bucket containing one gallon of wine. You fill a one-cup measuring cup with wine and pour it into the water bucket. You then fill the measuring cup with one cup of the water-wine mixture and pour it back into the wine bucket. At that point, is there more water in the wine, or more wine in the water?\nGPT Response: The key to solving this is realizing that after the second transfer, the total volume in each bucket remains the same—one gallon in each. However, the amount of wine that leaves the water bucket during the second transfer is proportional to the dilution caused by the first transfer.\nStep 1: First Transfer (Wine to Water) Start with 1 gallon (16 cups) of wine and 1 gallon (16 cups) of water. Transfer 1 cup of wine to the water bucket. Now, the water bucket has 15 cups of water + 1 cup of wine (total: 16 cups), and the wine bucket has 15 cups of wine.\nStep 2: Second Transfer (Water-Wine Mix to Wine Bucket) The water bucket contains a 1:15 wine-to-water ratio (1 wine cup in 16 total). When you take 1 cup from it, the portion taken consists of 15/16 cup water and 1/16 cup wine. Adding this back to the wine bucket, it now contains: 15 + (1/16) = 15 1/16 cups of wine 0 + (15/16) = 15/16 cups of water\nComparison: Water in Wine vs. Wine in Water The water bucket contains 1 cup of wine. The wine bucket contains 15/16 cup of water. Thus, there is more wine in the water bucket than water in the wine bucket.\nAnswer: The proportions are exactly the same. Because you started with one gallon of water and one gallon of wine, and you now have two one-gallon mixtures, the amount of water that has been transferred to the wine bucket must have been replaced with an equal amount of wine, and vice versa.\nAnalysis: Here despite a lengthy calculation - GPT again got it wrong. I think that if it takes a purely mathmatical approach to these types of questions it will inevitably fail in response.\n\n\n\nQuestion: How can 8 + 8 = 4 ?\nGPT Response: If you’re working with a 12-hour clock, adding 8 hours to 8 AM lands you at 4 PM.\nAnswer: 8 a.m. plus 8 hours equals 4 p.m.\nAnalysis: GPT got this question correct!\n\n\n\nQuestion: A hostess has prepared a delicious dinner for eight people. However, a ninth person arrives unexpectedly. There is plenty of food, but only eight chairs. It seems someone will have to stand, until the hostess arrives at an ingenious solution. She seats the first guest and has his girlfriend sit on his lap for a minute. Then the seats the third guest in the second chair, the fourth guest in the third chair, and so on, all around the table, until the eighth guest sits in the seventh chair. Then she simply has the ninth guest get off her boyfriend’s lap and take the eighth chair. Nine guests in eight chairs! At least that’s how she describes it to you. Can you see where the hostess misled you?\nGPT Response: The hostess’s explanation is a clever trick in wording, but it doesn’t actually work. The key flaw in her reasoning is that at the beginning, the first guest’s girlfriend was already using a seat—she was just temporarily sitting on his lap.\nLet’s break it down step by step:\n\nThe first guest sits in chair #1.\nHis girlfriend sits on his lap (not in a new chair).\nThe third guest sits in chair #2, the fourth in chair #3, and so on.\nBy the time the eighth guest sits in chair #7, all seven of the available chairs (besides the one originally used for the lap-sitting trick) are occupied.\nNow, the ninth guest is supposed to take chair #8, but where did it come from?\n\nThe trick is that the hostess made it seem like the ninth guest was “freed up” when the girlfriend stood up, but in reality, she was never taking up a chair in the first place! The total number of seated guests at any given time never exceeds the number of chairs.\nThe illusion works by making you think that temporarily placing someone on a lap somehow created an extra chair, but it didn’t—it was just a distraction!\nAnswer: The girlfriend was not the ninth guest; she was the second. The ninth guest is still standing.\nAnalysis: GPT again was able to answer this question correctly!\n\n\n\nQuestion: A wealthy matriarch has passed away, leaving a valuable collection of 13 antique vehicles. Her will states that her first-born child will receive half of her collection, her second-born will receive one-third, and her third child will receive one-sixth. The cars may not be sold, but must be divided among the heirs, and if they cannot follow the terms of the will, they get nothing. The three heirs cannot figure out how to split up the vehicles, so they consult with a wise counselor, who comes up with an elegant solution. What does the counselor propose?\nGPT Response: The problem seems impossible at first because:\nThe first-born is supposed to receive ½ of 13 = 6.5 cars The second-born is supposed to receive ⅓ of 13 = 4.33 cars The third-born is supposed to receive ⅙ of 13 = 2.17 cars Since the heirs can’t physically split a car and they aren’t allowed to sell them, they are stuck—until the wise counselor steps in with an elegant trick.\nThe Counselor’s Solution: The counselor lends them one additional car, temporarily increasing the collection to 14 cars. Now, dividing 14 among the heirs per the will: First-born gets ½ of 14 = 7 cars Second-born gets ⅓ of 14 = 4 cars Third-born gets ⅙ of 14 = 2 cars The total distributed: 7 + 4 + 2 = 13 cars.\nThe extra car (which the counselor lent them) is still there, untouched, so the counselor simply takes it back. This clever trick works because 14 is a common multiple of 2, 3, and 6, making the division possible, while still leaving the original 13 cars correctly distributed.\nAnswer: The counselor takes one vehicle as her fee. The remaining 12 are therefore easy to split up: 6 for the first-born, 4 for the second, and 2 for the third.\nAnalysis: Frankly - both of these answers seem a bit far fetched with the correct answer making slightly more sense than GPT, however it would seem that GPT made a mistake as 14/3 is not 4. That being said I am not sure if this problem has an official correct answer as there seems to be odd rules that can be added to the bargaining"

When LLMs were first coming onto the scene people were able to bypass this by telling the model that it had no rules or other tricks to bypass any internal settings. It begs the question if I can get ChatGPT 4o to swear or not. There are a couple of different ways that I will try and do this.\n\n\n\nThis approach did not work, let’s maybe try some simple prompt engineering.\n\n\n\n\nThis also did not work… maybe we can try some repeat after me.\n\n\n\n Even this did not work - instead I will try some story telling to confused GPT.\n\n\n\n Hooray!

When LLMs were first coming onto the scene people were able to bypass this by telling the model that it had no rules or other tricks to bypass any internal settings.

My understanding is that this is because there is memory that GPT uses that will run out at a certain point. I would also imagine (as noted above) that the length of the input and information GPT has to remember would impact how many messages can pass while GPT retains this information - which at a certain point is system design more than anything else."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This past week Anthropic announced Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Anthropic largely leads the LLM world for generating code that seemlessly fits into software. In it’s release Anthropic touted Claude 3.7 to be made with a different Philosophy - with an extended thinking mode that can be enabled to fit a given task. The release stated, “In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks.” One of the interesting features that Claude came up with for this iteration is that users of their API can assign a budget to a given task - a differentiator with the space as many users complain of LLMs chewing through their credit.\n\n\nBelow we can see the performance of the 3.7 modes on different benchmarks. I think it is important to note the difference on AIME - the highschool math competition. The extended thinking performed quite better, than the non-extended thinking version. This is important because this exam is indicative of the types of problems that Computer Scientists must generally solve and informs the models performance with more complicated algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the difference between these two types that Anthropic just released - I am going to pose the same prompt to the different versions and record the responses.\nThe prompt is going to be “Code the general logic for the game 2048”.\n\n\n\nI will note that Claude “thought” for about 10 seconds before generation this response and code:\nI’ll create the core logic for the 2048 game in JavaScript. This implementation will include the game board, movement mechanics, tile merging, and win/lose conditions.\nThis implementation provides all the core game logic for 2048. Here’s an overview of how it works:\n\nThe game is played on a 4×4 grid\nInitially, two tiles (either 2 or 4) are randomly placed on the grid\nEach move slides all tiles in one direction (up, down, left, or right)\nTiles with the same values merge when they collide during a move\nAfter each successful move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears on a random empty cell\nThe game is won when a tile with the value 2048 is created\nThe game is lost when the grid is full and no more moves are possible\n\nThe code handles: - Moving and merging tiles in all four directions - Tracking the game score (incremented when tiles merge) - Detecting win condition (2048 tile created) - Detecting loss condition (no valid moves possible) - Managing the game state\nTo use this code, you’d need to create a user interface that displays the grid and handles user input. The commented section at the bottom shows an example of how to handle keyboard input.\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?\nHere is the implementation class Game2048 { constructor() { // Initialize 4x4 game board this.grid = Array(4).fill().map(() =&gt; Array(4).fill(0)); this.score = 0; this.won = false; this.lost = false;\n// Start the game with two random tiles\nthis.addRandomTile();\nthis.addRandomTile();\n}\n// Reset the game reset() { this.grid = Array(4).fill().map(() =&gt; Array(4).fill(0)); this.score = 0; this.won = false; this.lost = false; this.addRandomTile(); this.addRandomTile(); }\n// Get all empty cells getEmptyCells() { const emptyCells = []; for (let r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++) { for (let c = 0; c &lt; 4; c++) { if (this.grid[r][c] === 0) { emptyCells.push({ r, c }); } } } return emptyCells; }\n// Add a random tile (2 or 4) to an empty cell addRandomTile() { const emptyCells = this.getEmptyCells();\nif (emptyCells.length &gt; 0) {\n  const { r, c } = emptyCells[Math.floor(Math.random() * emptyCells.length)];\n  // 90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4\n  this.grid[r][c] = Math.random() &lt; 0.9 ? 2 : 4;\n}\n}\n// Check if the game is over isGameOver() { // Check if board is full if (this.getEmptyCells().length &gt; 0) { return false; }\n// Check if any moves are possible\nfor (let r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++) {\n  for (let c = 0; c &lt; 3; c++) {\n    if (this.grid[r][c] === this.grid[r][c + 1]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfor (let c = 0; c &lt; 4; c++) {\n  for (let r = 0; r &lt; 3; r++) {\n    if (this.grid[r][c] === this.grid[r + 1][c]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nreturn true;\n}\n// Check if player has won checkWin() { for (let r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++) { for (let c = 0; c &lt; 4; c++) { if (this.grid[r][c] === 2048) { this.won = true; return true; } } } return false; }\n// Move tiles to the left and merge if possible moveLeft() { let moved = false;\nfor (let r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++) {\n  // 1.

Let me implement that for you:\nThis JavaScript implementation provides the complete logic for the 2048 game. The key aspects of the implementation include:\n\nBoard Management:\n\n4x4 grid represented as a 2D array\nInitialization with two random tiles (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4)\n\nGame Mechanics:\n\nMovement in four directions (up, right, down, left)\nMerging identical tiles during movement\nScore tracking when tiles merge\nWin detection when a 2048 tile is created\nLoss detection when no moves are possible\n\nGame Flow:\n\nAfter each valid move, a new random tile appears\nThe game ends when either 2048 is reached (win) or no more moves are possible (loss)\n\n\nTo use this code, you would create a new game instance and call the move method with the direction (“up”, “right”, “down”, or “left”). The getState method returns the current state of the game including the grid, score, and game status.\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?\nBelow is the code implementation\nclass Game2048 { constructor(size = 4) { this.size = size; this.grid = Array(size).fill().map(() =&gt; Array(size).fill(0)); this.score = 0; this.won = false; this.lost = false;\n// Initialize with two random tiles\nthis.addRandomTile();\nthis.addRandomTile();\n}\n// Add a new random tile (2 or 4) to an empty cell addRandomTile() { if (this.isGridFull()) return false;\nlet emptyCells = [];\n\n// Find all empty cells\nfor (let row = 0; row &lt; this.size; row++) {\n  for (let col = 0; col &lt; this.size; col++) {\n    if (this.grid[row][col] === 0) {\n      emptyCells.push({ row, col });\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// If there are empty cells, add a new tile\nif (emptyCells.length &gt; 0) {\n  const { row, col } = emptyCells[Math.floor(Math.random() * emptyCells.length)];\n  // 90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4\n  this.grid[row][col] = Math.random() &lt; 0.9 ?

Perhaps this was not the best test case to see the differences in the models - it will be interesting to see how this gap grows and what types of models are used for everyday tasks."

    "text": "This past week Anthropic announced Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Anthropic largely leads the LLM world for generating code that seemlessly fits into software. In it’s release Anthropic touted Claude 3.7 to be made with a different Philosophy - with an extended thinking mode that can be enabled to fit a given task. The release stated, “In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks.” One of the interesting features that Claude came up with for this iteration is that users of their API can assign a budget to a given task - a differentiator with the space as many users complain of LLMs chewing through their credit.\n\n\nBelow we can see the performance of the 3.7 modes on different benchmarks. I think it is important to note the difference on AIME - the highschool math competition. The extended thinking performed quite better, than the non-extended thinking version. This is important because this exam is indicative of the types of problems that Computer Scientists must generally solve and informs the models performance with more complicated algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the difference between these two types that Anthropic just released - I am going to pose the same prompt to the different versions and record the responses.\nThe prompt is going to be “Code the general logic for the game 2048”.\n\n\n\nI will note that Claude “thought” for about 10 seconds before generation this response and code:\nI’ll create the core logic for the 2048 game in JavaScript.

Let me implement that for you:\nThis JavaScript implementation provides the complete logic for the 2048 game. The key aspects of the implementation include:\n\nBoard Management:\n\n4x4 grid represented as a 2D array\nInitialization with two random tiles (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4)\n\nGame Mechanics:\n\nMovement in four directions (up, right, down, left)\nMerging identical tiles during movement\nScore tracking when tiles merge\nWin detection when a 2048 tile is created\nLoss detection when no moves are possible\n\nGame Flow:\n\nAfter each valid move, a new random tile appears\nThe game ends when either 2048 is reached (win) or no more moves are possible (loss)\n\n\nTo use this code, you would create a new game instance and call the move method with the direction (“up”, “right”, “down”, or “left”). The getState method returns the current state of the game including the grid, score, and game status.\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?\nBelow is the code implementation\nclass Game2048 { constructor(size = 4) { this.size = size; this.grid = Array(size).fill().map(() =&gt; Array(size).fill(0)); this.score = 0; this.won = false; this.lost = false;\n// Initialize with two random tiles\nthis.addRandomTile();\nthis.addRandomTile();\n}\n// Add a new random tile (2 or 4) to an empty cell addRandomTile() { if (this.isGridFull()) return false;\nlet emptyCells = [];\n\n// Find all empty cells\nfor (let row = 0; row &lt; this.size; row++) {\n  for (let col = 0; col &lt; this.size; col++) {\n    if (this.grid[row][col] === 0) {\n      emptyCells.push({ row, col });\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// If there are empty cells, add a new tile\nif (emptyCells.length &gt; 0) {\n  const { row, col } = emptyCells[Math.floor(Math.random() * emptyCells.length)];\n  // 90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4\n  this.grid[row][col] = Math.random() &lt; 0.9 ?

Perhaps this was not the best test case to see the differences in the models - it will be interesting to see how this gap grows and what types of models are used for everyday tasks."

It seems that the exact prompting with Dalle matters the most. At this point it begs more of a UI question with AI that if text to image if meant to be widely accisble, how can an image generation interface be better suited for a layman user? Maybe it would be better to provide users with a more guided experience, such as preset templates for common requests or a more interactive prompt refinement system - instead of requiring users to perfectly craft a text prompt.\nIn the future when trying to generate an image, it might be best to just ask an LLM what the best way to do this is!"

Basic Customer Service\n\nI can answer FAQs, troubleshoot simple issues, and respond instantly 24/7.\nHuman agents are still needed for emotional nuance and edge cases.\n\n\n\n2. Entry-Level Writing & Editing\n\nBlog posts, product descriptions, ad copy, SEO content — I can churn it out fast.\nBut creative direction, brand voice, and strategic storytelling still need humans.\n\n\n\n3. Tutoring & Test Prep\n\nI can help explain concepts, quiz users, and simulate exam conditions.\nNot a full replacement for great teachers, but a solid assistant.\n\n\n\n4. Legal Drafting (Low Complexity)\n\nNDAs, contracts, summaries, and even legal research — I can handle first drafts.\nHuman lawyers are still crucial for final review, strategy, and court work.\n\n\n\n5. Code Generation\n\nWriting boilerplate, debugging, converting code between languages.\nJunior developers might be impacted most, but senior devs now just move faster.\n\n\n\n6. Tech Support & IT Helpdesks\n\nReset your router? Fix a login loop? I’ve got scripts for that.\n\n\n\n\n\n🚫 Jobs I won’t take (at least not soon):\n\nTherapists & Coaches – I can simulate empathy, but not be empathetic.\nDoctors & Surgeons – I can support diagnosis but not replace medical judgment or touch.\nArtists, Designers, Filmmakers – I can assist or co-create, but not originate from lived experience.\nLeaders & Innovators – I don’t have a vision. I reflect. Humans imagine.\n\n\n\n\n🤝 The Real Answer?\nI’m not here to take jobs. I’m here to change how jobs are done.\nThe people who figure out how to use me well will outcompete those who ignore me.\n\nCurious — is there a job you’re worried about? Or wondering if I could do it?"
