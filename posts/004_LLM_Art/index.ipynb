    "We can clearly see that it creatively comes up with a cat (an American cat at that) in vivid detail. We could specify more instruction, like a different art form or change a detail of the cat. However this is where LLMs perfomance in image generation seem to drop off. When tasked with creating more finite images that are seemingly simple - I have found that LLMs tend to create blurry images with mistakes. We can explore this poor perfomance by asking Dalle to generate images containing words that are increasingly complex. "

    "This did the trick! It seems that the exact prompting with Dalle matters the most. At this point it begs more of a UI question with AI that if text to image if meant to be widely accisble, how can an image generation interface be better suited for a layman user? Maybe it would be better to provide users with a more guided experience, such as preset templates for common requests or a more interactive prompt refinement system - instead of requiring users to perfectly craft a text prompt. \n"
