    "One of the challenges with Image diffusion models is that the images generated often lack control / realistic context. There are limited platforms that allow for easy image generation once the inital image has been diffused. Google recently launched their Gemini 2.0 Flash model that has this feature - we will give it a try and make some incremental changes.\n",

    "The model performed amazingly - iterating on the same image adding bits and pieces as needed. It was interesting how on this last prompt for the image to be at night - it really portrayed a dark image. This type of image generation is going to open the door for marketters and anyone who needs to make incremental chnges to an image.\n"
