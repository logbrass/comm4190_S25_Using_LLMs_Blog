    "Like many, I am a big fan of NYT Games - the MINI, Wordle, Connections, and Sudoku are all some of my favorties that I play daily. These are all little puzzles that require a certain level of cognition to solve. As a result - I think it would be interesting to see if ChatGPT can solve the Hard Sudoku and the connections puzzles.\n",

    "Overall GPT performed poorloy on both of these tasks. For the Sudoku it seemed as though there were concepts of a plan - that is it was able to think through the right approach keeping the rules in mind. I'm sure if I prompted it through GPT would have been able to solve the puzzle. For Connections - GPT performed horrendously, tripping through the task with incorrect logic - arriving at the right answer. Looks like all of the Puzzle Solvers out there still have a job for the near future."
